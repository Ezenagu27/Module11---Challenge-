In this challenge, I identified HTML elements on a page, identified their id and class attributes, using this knowledge to extract information via both 
automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.
Through out this Challenge, I collected data, organized and stored data, analyzed data, and then visually communicated my insights.

I have submited the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

I then Exported this Data into a CSV file.
